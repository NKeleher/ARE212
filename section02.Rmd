# Summary of last time

- Installing and loading packages
- File paths (finding, changing, defining)
- Loading data (.dta and .csv)

__Follow up:__

- We had issues downloading files straight from GitHub. To avoid future issues, I am creating links to download files within the notes. Sorry!
- Someone asked about creating folders in R. To create a folder, use the `dir.create()` function. _E.g._ `dir.create("TestFolder")` should create a new folder named "TestFolder" in your current directory. To see if it worked, type `dir()`. You can also check whether a folder already exists using the `dir.exists()` function, _e.g._ `dir.exists("TestFolder")`.
