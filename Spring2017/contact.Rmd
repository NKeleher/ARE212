I will hold weekly office hours in room 234 in Giannini Hall on Fridays from 10am until 12pm.

Please feel free to contact me (Ed) through email via edward`ampersat`berkeley`period`edu. I will get back to you as soon as possible. I will probably respond to shorter and more specific emails faster, since I am a human.
